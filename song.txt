Leaving through the back door
Freezing in the cold
Communication breakdown
Emotional overload
Been through a wall of fire
Now I feel like, the ashes glow
Cars passing on the freeway
My mind is on the run
I keep running from my shadow
I'm not the only one
Somewhere in the distance
Someone's taking flight
Destination unknown
Just fade into the light
There's so much said and done
But after all
The time has come, to leave it all
Behind
If you could see it through my eyes
You's know I tried to change it all
I've been trying all my life
To stand up every time I fall
If you could see it through my eyes
